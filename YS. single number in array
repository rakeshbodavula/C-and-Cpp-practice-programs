/*  Ex:- arr=[1,2,1,3,2],n=5--> 1,2 are repeated twice and 3 is unique.
    This is just to show that XOR can be used to check if the number is repeated even times or odd times.
    if it is repeated even times XOR will be 0 else XOR is equal to the number which is repeated.
    conditions:- only one element should be unique and remaining elements should repeat even times.
